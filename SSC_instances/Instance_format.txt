## DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM INSTANCES ##
In all computational tests, Euclidean distances rounded up to the next integer value are used.

The instances are formatted as follows:
-	Line 1: number of customers (n)
-	Line 2: number of charging stations (r)
-	Line 3: number of electric vehicles in fleet
-	Line 4: number of conventional vehicles in fleet
-	Line 5: dummy entry
-	Line 6: maximum route duration
-	Line 7: battery capacity
-	Line 8: energy consumption per distance unit travelled
-	Line 9: recharging rate
-	Line 10: vehicle capacity
-	Line 11: demand at node 0,…,n
-	Line 12: service time at node 0,…,n
-	Line 13: coordinates of depot 0
-	Line 14 to 14+n: coordinates of customers 1,…,n
-	Line 15+n to 15+n+r: coordinates of recharging stations 1,…,r
